    <div class="centered"><p class><h3>Akihabara is the name for the area around Akihabara station in downtown Tokyo, often referred to as Akiba by 
the local Japanese people. Sometimes called Akihabara Electric Town, the area is well known for selling a wide 
variety of electronic goods, mainly focusing on household electronics. Once computers became widely available 
to the public, specialized stores for computers were integrated into the area as well. Although more recently 
(and arguably more well-known today), Akihabara has become the center of otaku culture in Japan and most 
of the stores you find will be related to anime, manga, and/or video games. Attracting anime enthusiasts 
every day, it is no surprise to see people in cosplay walking along the streets as they 
shop in Akiba. Many of the stores in Akihabara cater to anime and cosplay enthusiasts with great outfit 
accessories, exclusive Japanese video games, and limited edition collectible anime memorabilia. 
Find great exclusive anime and video game goods while traveling through the anime capital of the world!</div>
